# API CRUD integrated with MongoDB:


The Solution:

  Create the "Employee Manager" app, an API that must have:
  API with employees CRUD:
  GET: /employees/ (employee list)
  POST: /employees/ (employee create)
  UPDATE /employees/ID/ (employee update)
  DELETE /employees/ID/ (employee delete)
  GET /employees/ID/ (employee detail)
  
  
API with reports:

  GET /reports/employees/salary/ (salary report)
  GET /reports/employees/age/ (age report)
  
  
Persist data in a database
Use authentication to access
